## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start** - Game starts immediately on launch
2. **Tap** - Tap anywhere to flip direction (up ↔ down)
3. **Avoid** - Don't hit the red obstacles
4. **Score** - Travel as far as possible
5. **Restart** - Tap after game over to instantly restart

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

1. **Responsiveness First** - Input must feel instant
2. **Minimal Friction** - No menus, instant restart
3. **Clear Feedback** - Player always knows what happened
4. **Addictive Loop** - Easy to learn, hard to master
5. **Performance** - 60 FPS or nothing

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run in profile mode for performance testing
flutter run --profile

# Run in release mode for final testing
flutter run --release
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- Monitor FPS counter in top-right during gameplay
- Target: Sustained 60 FPS on mid-range devices
- Test on multiple platforms for consistency

## 🐛 Known Issues
None currently! 🎉
